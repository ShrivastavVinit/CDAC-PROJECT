Stabilization of dune sand using fly ash




Soil stabilization is done for the improvements in bearing capabilities and performance of in-situ sub soils. The addition of fly ash to cohesionless soil (sandy soil) increases the bearing capacity due to the frictional resistance (cohesion) in between fly ash particles. This stabalizer was specially selected because of its higer availability and cheaper price.
